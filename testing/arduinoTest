We tested the arduino and found out that the errors 
come out to be of the order of about .3 cms in the 
process of measurement of distances with .
3.0 cm - 2.3 cm - N
6.0 cm - 5.7 cm - Y
7.0 cm - 7.1 cm - Y
10.0 cm - 10.2 cm - Y
15.0 cm - 14.8 cm - Y
25.0 cm - 25.0 cm - Y
30.0 cm - 29.8 cm - Y
40.0 cm - 39.8 cm - Y
50.0 cm - 50.3 cm - Y
60.0 cm - 60.7 cm - N
80.0 cm - 80.3 cm - Y
100.0 cm - 100.4 cm -N 
In the tested range, our device seems works with acceptable 
outputs.

First Iteration

For the first iteration of the software project our group has uploaded a video on the working demonstration of the water level measurement device. Presently the device can be used to measure water level of any reservoirs to an accuracy of 0.3 cm for a distance of about 0.1 m to 1.5 m. The data that is generated by the device is displayed on the screen of the computer to which the device is connected, and is later expected to be stored in a database.

This device also has an alarm that will warn the potential users of any threat to the device by flashing an led as soon as the reading takes a value of 10 cm or less, indicative of an obstruction in the way of the device or a more serious threat of a dangerous increase in water level.

Now we are also working on a website which will accomplish the task of uploading this data to a server where it will be stored and the data will be accessed through a portal that will be protected by a secure login. This is expected to come in a working condition very soon.
